    <p>We began working with Healthcare Success in early 2012 to market our outpatient family medicine and urgent care centers. Their efforts included creation of branded collateral, new website for Pomona Valley Health Centers and targeted media including TV, print and search engine marketing. They also trained our staff on phone skills and customer service. Finally, they consulted on doctor referral marketing with our physician liaisons.</p>

<p>Thank you for the awesome job you did on my website. Since my practice area is fairly unique (providing in-home behavior therapy for children with autism), I could not use an off-the-shelf, “cookie-cutter” website. You and your staff did an amazing job understanding my practice and my market and tailoring the website to our clientele. You requested and used my input along the way but your creativity is what makes the site unique. Within the past year, we had two new competitors move into our area, so we needed to do something to maintain our market share. I would highly recommend your services to any health care professional who is serious about marketing in a professional, ethical, and effective manner.</p>
